Install Runner:

follow the page
1. download the packages
2. install
3. register with gitlab project token

[root@sb002 tmp]# curl -L "https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/runner/gitlab-runner/script.rpm.sh" | sudo bash
systemctl status gitlab-runner
wget https://s3.dualstack.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/gitlab-runner-downloads/latest/rpm/gitlab-runner_amd64.rpm
[root@sb002 tmp]# dnf install -y /tmp/gitlab-runner_amd64.rpm
[root@sb002 tmp]# systemctl status gitlab-runner
 cat /etc/hosts [add the github server name and IP]
 sudo gitlab-runner register -n --url http://shamrat-sb --registration-token glrt-cy0rGO5pf7XCHOnbTvls1G86MQpwOjEKdDozCnU6Mg8.01.1702h9d8s --executor docker --description "Deployment Runner" --docker-image "docker:stable" --tag-list deployment --docker-privileged

====================================

Runner & Executor:

- have add a runner with gitlab
- has to be a separate machine
- has to install gitlag-runner libraries before registration
- host based runner & project based runner, these are the 2 kinds of runner 
- better to add hostbased runner, that will be available for all the projects
- you can also add project based runner as well

- Executor nedd to be selected during the time of runner registration
- for basic learning and practice better to use bash executor
- docker and other executor can also be selected 

- you can also configure runner and executor separately, and use them by project basis

Enter the GitLab instance URL (for example, https://gitlab.com/):
[http://shamrat-sb]: 
Verifying runner... is valid                        runner=TaG1H2v15

Enter a name for the runner. This is stored only in the local config.toml file:
[sb002.myguest.virtualbox.org]: 

Enter an executor: parallels, docker+machine, docker-autoscaler, instance, docker-windows, kubernetes, custom, shell, ssh, virtualbox, docker:
shell
Runner registered successfully. Feel free to start it, but if it's running already the config should be automatically reloaded!
 
Configuration (with the authentication token) was saved in "/etc/gitlab-runner/config.toml"
